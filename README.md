**+++ABOUT THIS APP:**<br>

A simple app allows a user to create an account, and manage their collection of plants they work with. <br>
This app uses two separate Mongo DB collections to store bcrypted User Accounts and plant items generated by each user. <br>
<br>
Passport.js implemented to authenticte users and create a session cookie.<br>
Upon arrival, Passport attaches req.user when a user is logged into a session, to allow Angular.js to conditionally hide/show features.
In an instance; for example, req.user is being attached to window object as window.user to show conditional situations, like logging out.

API endpoints are as well implemented with Passport.js 'req.isAuthenticated()' to either return 'next()' or a status of 401.

<br>
Designed with an Angular.js factory service; allows the List controller to make AJAX CRUD requests to the app's API endpoints,
$routeProvider to serve partial html views and ngShow as provides a method of condition to show or hide UI features
ngRepeat is used to construct the plant items to the list display.<br>
